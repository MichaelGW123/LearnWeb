# Webpage Consolidation

This project aims to create an HTML webpage that consolidates links to various webpages for easier and quicker access. The webpage will be hosted on Amazon S3, allowing you to access it from anywhere.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to centralize the links to different webpages that you frequently visit or need quick access to. By creating a single HTML webpage that contains these links, you can easily navigate to your desired webpages without the need to remember or search for each individual link.

## Deployment

To deploy the webpage and host it on Amazon S3, follow these steps:

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one already.
2. Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to host the webpage.
3. Upload the HTML file, CSS file, and any necessary image files to the S3 bucket.
4. Configure the S3 bucket to enable static website hosting.
5. Make the HTML file public and obtain its URL.

## Usage

Once the webpage is deployed and hosted on Amazon S3, you can access it from any device with an internet connection. Simply open a web browser and enter the URL of the hosted HTML file. The webpage will load, displaying the consolidated links organized by different categories or topics.

You can customize the webpage by modifying the HTML file and adding or removing links based on your preferences. The CSS file can also be modified to change the styling and layout of the webpage.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point and adapt it to suit your specific needs. Enjoy the convenience of having all your frequently accessed webpages in one place!
